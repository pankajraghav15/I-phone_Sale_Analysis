# I-phone_Sale_Analysis Project
Welcome to the iPhone Sales Analysis Project! This is my first data analytics project, where I explored iPhone sales data using Python, NumPy, and Pandas for analysis, and Plotly for creating insightful visualizations. This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in uncovering trends and patterns in sales data.In this project a large dataset of flipkart has analysed and visual representation of insights has been demonstrated. The data visualization is done through bar charts.
